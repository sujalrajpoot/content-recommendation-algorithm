# 🎯 Content Recommendation Algorithm

## 📝 Description
The Smart Content Engagement Algorithm is an intelligent content recommendation system that analyzes user interaction patterns to determine content preferences and engagement levels. Similar to platforms like Instagram and YouTube, this algorithm calculates user engagement scores based on multiple interaction metrics to provide personalized content suggestions.

## ⚙️ How It Works
The algorithm processes user engagement data through several key metrics:

### Engagement Metrics
- ⏱️ **Time Spent**: Weighted at 1.5x to emphasize content that holds user attention
- 👍 **Likes**: Fixed score of 30 points for liked content
- 🔄 **Shares**: 10 points per share, recognizing content's viral potential
- 💬 **Comments**: 20 points for commented content, valuing active participation

### Scoring System
1. Calculates a raw engagement score using the formula:
   ```
   raw_score = (time_spent × 1.5) + (30 if liked) + (shares × 10) + (20 if commented)
   ```
2. Converts raw scores to percentages based on maximum possible engagement
3. Ranks content based on engagement percentages
4. Stores top two highest-scoring entries per user

## 🎁 Benefits for Users
- 📊 Personalized content recommendations based on actual engagement
- 🎯 More accurate content targeting
- 🔄 Dynamic scoring that adapts to user behavior
- ⏰ Time-weighted engagement metrics for better relevance
- 📈 Improved user experience through tailored content

## 🛠️ Technical Details
### Input Requirements
- JSON file containing user interaction data
- Data structure:
  ```json
  {
    "user_id": [
      {
        "time_spent": float,
        "liked": boolean,
        "shares": integer,
        "commented": boolean,
